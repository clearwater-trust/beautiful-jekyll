That’s a good question. For this exercise, and in light of king makers and [Washington DC whores](https://cryptobriefing.com/senator-elizabeth-warren-slams-bitcoins-energy-usage/) sucking the toes of unaccountable Wall Street demons, let’s consider the following comparison:

How much POWER does it take to run any/all blockchains. (in this example we’ll be using bitcoin)
**VS.**
How much POWER it takes to run the FEDERAL RESERVE.

[Bitcoin currently consumes 125.46 EH/s (ExaHash per second)– That’s One hundred and twenty five quintillion computations (hashes) per second to secure the network. Quintillion. That’s a fun word. https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/hashrate-chart](https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/hashrate-chart)

**THE FEDERAL RESERVE** currently consumes the entire planet with fear and panic. [Staggering fiat debt in trillions of dollars](https://usdebtclock.org/). Gobal derivative markets calculated in quadrillions. All lost in a soup of unaccountable-accounting only the highest level charlatans and thieves know how to calculate.

**THE FEDERAL RESERVE** employs entire [armies of men and missiles](https://www.illuminatirex.com/cia-secret-wars/) threatening the peace of any nation who dares to speak against it’s Babylonian system of damnation and dominance.

**THE FEDERAL RESERVE** powers [secret systems of finance](https://missingmoney.solari.com/) trading counterfeit bonds and obfuscated bullion on markets only their reptilian friends have access to.

**THE FEDERAL RESERVE** will stop at nothing to continue its reign of physical and psychological terror, killing innocent people in any and all countries that attempt to separate from the slave shackles of [fake money and debt peonage](https://www.somagnews.com/9-trillion-story-22-of-us-dollars-printed-in-2020/).

## **THE FEDERAL RESERVE** power requirements include DEATH, DESTRUCTION, CHAOS, and DOMESTIC/FOREIGN TERROR.

The current bitcoin hash rate is 125.46 EH/s (ExaHash per second)

Let’s put this one to bed.
