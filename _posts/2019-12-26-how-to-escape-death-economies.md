Paying for your own extinction is suicide. **Neoliberal Capitalism** and the unaccountable money maze of **Corporate Debt**, **Federal Reserve Policy**, and **Political Pageantry** is funding the destruction of the planet.

The valuation of stocks, bonds, and all financial instruments that use the money supply of dying empire does not correlate to reality. [Owning a fraction of a share of Wall Street nonsense indicates peak market insanity.](https://www.robinhood.com)

Attempting to correct the system by subsidizing anonymous corporations is a death spiral to hell.

The tried and true system of making war on anonymous people around the planet is ending.

Currency wars are a lie.

The call to arms by the corporate elite is a lie.

The call to arms by your government is a lie.

**The failure of neoliberal finance is NOT your problem.**

There is no escaping reality.
