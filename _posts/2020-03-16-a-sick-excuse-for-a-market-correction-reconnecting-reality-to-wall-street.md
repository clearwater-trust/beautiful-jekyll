There is nothing like a Pandemic to reconnect the illusion of reality to Wall Street returns. When your market goes up, and up, and up, and doesn’t respond to supply side economics (because the government injects trillions of dollars into the supply), when your market is no longer based in reality, your market is exposed as a fraud. A Nation State Ponzi scheme, Wall Street, Neoliberal Finance.

A Pandemic allows the market to correct (as if there is supply side shortage) by creating the illusion of natural market forces. The two seemingly being related to one another by cause and effect. But of course they are not.

## Reality has no effect on Wall Street. Owning a fraction of a share of corporate nonsense is exposed as a lie.

A pandemic allows corporate forces to manipulate prices on an already over-inflated heap of garbage financial statements. 

## A pandemic allows the unabated inflow of fake federal reserve dollars supporting the corporate elite’s money supply.

A pandemic is a sick excuse for a market correction.
