subtitle: Removing Monolithic Economies
---
Decentralization is our fight against monolithic economies.  Nation States and corporations that depend on creating conflict, organizations that feed on fear and terror, all systems controlling access to markets must be decentralized.

**Decentralization is personal agency.**

**Decentralization allows access and permission-less service.**


1. Decentralize communication.
2. Decentralize propaganda.
3. Decentralize money.
4. Decentralize war.


We don’t believe in utopia. We believe in freedom. That includes the freedom to pay for this, or that, and NOT THAT! I’m NOT PAYING FOR THAT!
