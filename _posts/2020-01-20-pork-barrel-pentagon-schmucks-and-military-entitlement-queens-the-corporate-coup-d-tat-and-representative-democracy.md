If voting really made a difference it would certainly be outlawed. The two party decision is a careful illusion devised by the capital elite to inspire your fear and hatred. There is NO viable option within the American experiment to defund Death Economies and the anonymous corporations that insist on destroying the planet.

## Only revolution will stop the redistribution of wealth to anonymous corporate overseers.
Real accountability through a shared ledger is a small part of what will be a victory for people everywhere.

Make no mistake, the Corporate State is capable of monstrous acts of annihilation. Although the resistance will be non-violent, The State will continue to murder anyone that stands in the way of their Wall Street power structure.

Good luck to all of you. And may The Force be with you. [Clearwater-Trust.com](https://clearwater-trust.com)
