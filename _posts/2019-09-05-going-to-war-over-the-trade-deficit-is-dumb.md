America imports more stuff than it exports.

America doesn’t manufacture much of anything (except weapon systems).

You are a sightless, reprogrammed, Manchurian Candidate if you think THE UNACCOUNTABLE US DOLLAR is worth fighting for.

**Let fake money die.**

**I Love America** because I can invest in the future and not get bogged down in repaying parasitic government/bank/corporations that are Too Big To Fail. again and again

Fool me once (**TARP**), shame on you. Fool me twice (**Trade and Currency Wars**), shame on me.

Don’t be shamed into paying for this shit. **Exit the system of fake accounting and fake money.**

Ask me how.
