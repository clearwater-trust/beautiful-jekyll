It hasn’t happened since the market crash of 2008. In those days it was called a **bailout**. Meaning the Fed was bailing out the banks because they were all underwater. After dismantling [Glass-Steagall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass–Steagall_legislation), American banks are totally free to screw you and me, borrowing at zero percent, holding a fraction in reserve and embezzling the rest.

> We can’t call it a bail out, bad optics, doesn’t poll well. We don’t want the president to tweet at us. This time we’ll call it a **technical correction**.

Wall Street is loving the free money. Money stolen from me and you. What are you going to do about it?
