There are major ongoing issues at the [US Treasury](https://fiscal.treasury.gov/). The following data is provided by fiscal.treasury.gov with data sets compiled by [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/data/FMSTREAS/MTS-Monthly-Treasury-Statement).

The massive amounts of **OUTLAYS** reported by the **US TREASURY** cannot be understated. One only needs to compare the **TOO BIG TO FAIL CRASH of 2008** to get a side by side comparison of the kind of collapse we are experiencing.

The talking heads will try to convince you this money is going to **CORPORATE STIMULUS** and bio-countermeasures, CDC, NIAID pseudo-science propaganda garbage. Certainly that is true to some extent, but folks, look at the data. It goes back to 1980. The 2008 crash doesnâ€™t even register. Look at the data points starting in APR 2020.

They are collapsing the system. Get ready. Endure to the end. Love, compassion, charity, respect.
