The first block created on Bitcoin’s blockchain contains, along with the normal data, the following text:

_> The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks_

This was probably intended as proof that the block was created on or after January 3rd, 2009, as well as a comment on the instability caused by fractional-reserve banking.

The first 50BTC block reward went to address 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa, though this reward can’t be spent due to a quirk in the way that the genesis block is expressed in the code (this may have been intentional).
