I’ve been in the blockchain space for a few years and I’d like to share with you my insight on what gives utility and value to a blockchain.

At its core, a blockchain is a very slow and costly database. The only thing that brings value to a blockchain is DECENTRALIZATION, DISTRIBUTION, and PRIVACY.

If a blockchain lacks any of these attributes then it cannot be considered valuable or useful for transactional proof.

Decentralization means the code is open source and cannot be controlled by a single organization, bank or government. One simple test for decentralization is asking if the code-base and its contributors can be subpoenaed, arrested and/or sued.

**Satoshi Nakomoto is dead, long live bitcoin!**

Distribution means the code is being operated by a statistically significant group of individuals that cannot collude to alter the ledger. This is measurable through node count and mining throughput.

**Self-sovereign finance without intermediaries!**

Bitcoin privacy is very poor. All transparent blockchains are Orwellian nightmares and should be avoided at all cost.

**XMR Monero is private and better than bitcoin!**

Finally, tying a coin to a national currency, sometimes called a “Stablecoin”, removes ALL utility from a blockchain. A decentralized blockchain allows individuals to exchange value without trusting a 3rd party. When you attempt to peg a currency/oil/gold to a tokenized asset you are trusting Facebook; which is ignorant and no better than the legacy banking systems we have now.

**A blockchain is backed by nothing except math(s).**

I am interested to see what zucker bucks becomes. There is a way for Facebook to utilize a blockchain in a decentralized way but I think hell will freeze over before Zuckerberg and governments give that kind of control to the people.

_Disclaimer: I may own zuckerbucks to pump and dump the market for my own financial gain._
