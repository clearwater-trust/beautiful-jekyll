The purpose of NATO and the UN is to BUY American Weapon Systems

Here is an excerpt of UN and NATO authorities talking to the US Defense Department:

US DEFENSE DEPARTMENT: Please aim your weapons at the border.

UN and NATO AUTHORITIES: Can you give us money to buy your weapons?

US DEFENSE DEPARTMENT: Yes, we’ll provide contact info for CORPORATE STATE. They have what you’re looking for.

_High fives and solemn snickering fill the room_
