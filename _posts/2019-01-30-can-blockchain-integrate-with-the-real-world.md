Code is a mathematical concept not a physical reality. If you attempt to attach real world things to a blockchain, the utility is contaminated and rendered obsolete.  Therefore, it is without any input from reality that gives blockchain value. 

Money isn't real. Math is an abstraction. Blockchain can function as a transactional proof because people agree on code. The blockchain can be valuable only through people's agreements.  

Attempting to attach real world assets to a blockchain is opening up mathematics to subjective proofs, namely-- humans.
