Environmental Justice is the new [Manifest Destiny](https://www.zinnedproject.org/materials/indian-removal/).

The Future is now:
Creating real accountability through technology that is shared by everyone– shared accountability.

Actually finding something useful to do with global networks– like [shared accountability](https://bitcoin.org).

Understanding the effects of distributed, decentralized and encrypted blockchains– [shared accountability](https://getmonero.org).

Leveraging a global network of individuals that can access value through a permission-less, uncensorable, immutable ledger.
