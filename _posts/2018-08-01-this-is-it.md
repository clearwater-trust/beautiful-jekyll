subtitle: What to expect from my blockchain
---
A blockchain selected to account for value needs to be decentralized, distributed, open source and PRIVATE. Don't let anybody talk you out of these requirements.

**DECENTRALIZED**: everyone agrees that one bank/government controlling your value is STUPID.  

**DISTRIBUTED**: people choose the network. The network doesn't choose the people. The network cannot be stopped. Run a node.

**PRIVATE**: people should not be able to review your transactions unless they've been given permission BY YOU to do so. 

The issue is your money. What is it and where did it come from?  Where is it going? Who controls it? Who wants it? Who needs it? Who created it? Why is it money?

There will be blockchains from many providers promising many different things. Pick the blockchain that gives you the power.
