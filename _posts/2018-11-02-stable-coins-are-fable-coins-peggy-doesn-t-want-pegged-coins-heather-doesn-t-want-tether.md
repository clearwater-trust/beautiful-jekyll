The blockchain accounts for all transactions on the network without input from fallible humans. Introduce stable coins. Supposedly, there is a great OZ operating a bank account that contains equal amounts of fiat dollars/oil/(insert commodity here). 

It doesn't take a genius to see the failure in this system. How much is your blockchain worth? 

Bitcoin/Monero is backed by NOTHING except its member's agreements. This is its ultimate advantage. Inserting a bank/government/commodity into a monetary blockchain is for bankers and wall street rubes. It's a scam.
