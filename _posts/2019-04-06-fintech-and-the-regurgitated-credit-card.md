subtitle: Re-purposing the credit card and calling it FINTECH is a Wall Street ruse
---
Wall Street rubes and super unicorns are trying to repackage the credit card and call it FINTECH. Be advised: lipstick on a pig is quaint and fun but it’s nothing you want to tell your mother about. Third party payment services are funny haha. The credit card looks like a 50 year old clown to me. Relying on legacy banks and governments to account and allow for your transactions is a load of shit.

**Decentralized payment services and self-sovereign finance is the only “FINTECH” that matters.**

Stripe is a credit card feature.
Square is the shape of a credit card.
Venmo is a dystopian credit card mess.
Paypal will steal your money.
Nerdwallet is an embarrassing index of ripoff banks.

Re-purposing the credit card and calling it FINTECH is a Wall Street ruse. There is nothing superior, innovative and/or useful to payment services that use the same draconian gateways and government sponsored clearinghouses. The future of financial technology is on-boarding the billions of unbanked and removing third party services that reject, remove, correlate, steal, sell and resell your account. The future is the blockchain.

**Keep your keys. Own the future. FINTECH is on the blockchain.**
