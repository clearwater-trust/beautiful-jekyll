Is your blockchain distributed and decentralized? Do you know what makes bitcoin-- bitcoin?  Do you know why Satoshi Nakamoto will never be found and is already dead (RIP [Hal Finney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Finney_(computer_scientist "Satoshi Nakamoto")) The answer is **decentralization** and **distribution**. Only blockchains that are decentralized and distributed are appropriate for stores of monetary value.

I can think of many practical uses for state/corporate sponsored blockchains. Transparent, REAL accountability powered by the blockchain is our future. **However, these blockchains are NOT appropriate for monetary exchange.**

**Only blockchains that are decentralized and distributed are appropriate for stores of monetary value.**

One easy test for decentralization and distribution is to ask yourself if your blockchain can be subpoenaed, litigated and/or sued ([XRP](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/09/08/blockchain-enterprise-firms-r3-and-ripple-sue-each-other-over-1-billion-of-cryptocurrency/#16dd11854289)). This includes the development group and/or figureheads at the top of your blockchain ([ETH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin "Vitalik Buterin")).  If your development group gets 'shut-down' by the government, will your blockchain continue to thrive?
