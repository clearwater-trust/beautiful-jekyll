It’s important to understand that legislative attempts to outlaw person to person communications (by requiring private keys) is an attempt to outlaw the decentralized networks that will undermine everything the [Corporate State](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/) has been working to create in the last one hundred years:

- Wage Inequality
- Working Poor
- Perpetual War ([Corporate Weapon System Circlejerk](http://f35.com/))
- Neo Feudalism
- Surveillance Capitalism

Private Conversations Outlawed in the Name of Pedophilia.

End to End Encryption is Only for Satan.
