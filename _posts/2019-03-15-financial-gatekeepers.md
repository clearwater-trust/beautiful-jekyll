subtitle: Removing Financial Barriers
---
Erecting financial barriers in the name of regulation is last-century garbage. The tools used to control and organize people’s value will slowly give way to the free exchange of goods and services without state sponsored clearinghouses and manufactured scarcities.

**Fake money bankrolled by violence is yesterday’s bureaucracy.**

You cannot protect me from myself. I don’t need your approval. You cannot stop me from transacting with my friends and family around the world.
