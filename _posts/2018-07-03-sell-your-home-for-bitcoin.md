How to sell your home for **bitcoin** or **monero**.

**Considerations for selling your property for crypto.**
- Tax payments

- Just like cash
- All oustanding liens and loans will be paid in cash.

**Assuming you own the home outright.**
All sales tax will be paid in cash. Do you need a broker or a neautral third-party for your home sale in crypto? [Clearwater-Trust.com](https://clearwater-trust.com)

The sale will proceed just like a cash payment. Title comapny fees will be paid in cash.

**Assuming you owe outstanding mortgage.**
This is where a multi-signature wallet can come in handy. Funds will stay in escrow while the mortgage is paid.
